    <p><strong>The Mariner OS offers several key capabilities: </strong></p>
    <p><b>Mariner core:</b> Just enough core offering that will support a variety of profiles (Azure VM or on bare-metal
      x64 or ARM64) and allows the customer to build on top of it as needed.</p>
    <p><b>Efficient lifecycle management:</b> Mariner supports both RPM package and image-based update mechanisms,
      including support for OSTree style rollbacks. It will be provided with an "evergreen" release alongside specific
      security-patched stable snaps.</p>
    <p><b>Security hardened:</b> The kernel and other aspects of the OS are built with an emphasis on security and will
      follow the secure-by-default principle and compliant with Microsoft security standards and industry
      certifications.</p>
    <p><b>Federated Builds:</b> Enables teams to innovate on top by allowing the generation and maintenance of packages
      on top of the Mariner builds.</p>
    <p><b>Support for containers:</b> Mariner will support both a container host image that will include Docker and
      Kubernetes infrastructure as well as a container image that can be used as the base image for app development.</p>
