We're doing something a little different for our wedding registry. We've
worked hard to build our home in Portland, so for our wedding we'd like to
help build a home for someone else.
<br />
<br />

Habitat for Humanity is building 15 homes in the Cully neighborhood of Portland, and we're working with them to help furnish the homes with items everyone needs such as microwaves, vacuum cleaners, etc. By donating to Habitat for Humanity using the link below, you'll be able to earmark your donation for this project. Please celebrate our wedding by helping someone else make their home a reality.
